#   Pull request mechanism
GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) provide a way for developers to propose changes to a repository. Here's a general overview of how the GitHub Pull Request mechanism works:

1.  **Fork the Repository (Optional):**
    
    -   If you don't have write access to the repository, you can fork it to your own GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository under your account where you can make changes.
2.  **Create a Branch:**
    
    -   Create a new branch in the repository to isolate your changes. It's a good practice to create a branch for each feature or bug fix.
3.  **Make Changes:**
    
    -   Make your code changes in the branch you created. Once your changes are complete, commit them to your branch.
4.  **Push Changes to GitHub:**
    
    -   Push your branch with the changes to your fork or directly to the original repository.
5.  **Open a Pull Request:**
    
    -   In the GitHub repository, navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab and click on the "New Pull Request" button.
    -   Choose the branch you just pushed as the "compare" branch against the base branch (often `main` or `master`).
6.  **Review Changes:**
    
    -   Provide a title and description for your Pull Request, explaining the purpose of your changes.
    -   GitHub will automatically show a comparison of the changes you made in the PR.
7.  **Continuous Integration (Optional):**
    
    -   If the repository has CI/CD configured (using services like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, etc.), it will run tests and checks against your changes.
8.  **Request Reviews:**
    
    -   You can request reviews from specific individuals or teams. Reviewers can comment on the changes, approve the PR, or request further modifications.
9.  **Address Feedback:**
    
    -   Make any necessary changes based on the feedback received during the review process. You can push additional commits to the same branch, and the PR will automatically update.
10.  **Merge the Pull Request:**
11. 
    -   Once the PR has been approved and passes any required checks, you can merge it into the target branch.
12.  **Delete Branch (Optional):**
    
        -   After the PR is merged, you can choose to delete the branch if it's no longer needed.

GitHub provides a collaborative environment for code review and discussion during the PR process. The mechanism ensures that proposed changes are well-reviewed, tested, and integrated into the codebase in a controlled manner. It's a crucial part of the Git workflow for distributed development teams and open-source projects.
