## Summary of the meeting with the customer
The customer would like to hire external IT experts who can provide a solution to successfully migrate the company's semi-scripted tasks into a more mature automated solution.
Currently there are a lot of human errors during their work because there are many manual steps in their existing processes. They would like to have a framework that helps them "automate everything".
They also do not want to use complicated tools because it would be hard for their team to onboard and understand it. They also want to be able to collaborate on a shared environment/framework. 
The customer wants it to be ready as soon as possible. They also highlighted to following points:
- The provided solution should be documented as detailed as possible. They want to be able to easily teach this framework to their colleagues
- Possibility to test their code
- Introduce approval workflow
- They would like to have some example terraform codes
- From a technical perspective they want to have an integrated system that manages code, issue tracking and automated processes.

## Manager's request
- Based on the meeting notes try to brake down the project into tasks
- Create a sketch, diagramm or roadmap about the project. You could maybe use miro.com or draw.io
- Create a technical architect diagramm about the solution
