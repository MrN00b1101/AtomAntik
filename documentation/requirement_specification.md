## Summary of the meeting with the customer
The customer would like to hire external IT experts who can provide a solution to successfully migrate the company's semi-scripted tasks into a more mature automated solution.
Currently there are a lot of human errors during their work because there are many manual steps in their existing processes. They would like to have a framework that helps them "automate everything".
They also do not want to use complicated tools because it would be hard for their team to onboard and understand it. They also want to be able to collaborate on a shared environment/framework. 
The customer wants it to be ready as soon as possible. They also highlighted to following points:
- The provided solution should be documented as detailed as possible. They want to be able to easily teach this framework to their colleagues
- Possibility to test their code
- Introduce approval workflow
- They would like to have some example terraform codes
- From a technical perspective they want to have an integrated system that manages code, issue tracking and automated processes.

## Manager's request
- Based on the meeting notes try to brake down the project into tasks
- Create a sketch, diagramm or roadmap about the project. You could maybe use miro.com or draw.io
- Create a technical architect diagramm about the solution

## Requirements
As the customer requested the documentation should be as detailed as possible and he also wants to folow the development and the workflow. Because of this requirement we are using GitHub.
GitHub provides feautres such as:
- issues
- milestones
- projects
- pipelines
- documentation
- pull requests and code reviews
- approval workflows
- Etc...

The customer also requested a test code that can validiate every file that were created.

## Glossary
In this section we are covering the phrases we are using in the documentations for better understanding.

1. **Branch**
   -  A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.
2. **Commit**
   -  A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.
3. **Issue**
   -  Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion thread. You can also categorize an issue with labels and assign it to someone.
4. **Label**
   -  A tag on an issue or pull request. Repositories come with a handful of default labels, but users can create custom labels.
5. **Merge**
   -  Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line.
6. **Milestone**
   -  A way to track the progress on groups of issues or pull requests in a repository.
7. **README**
   -  A text file containing information about the files in a repository that is typically the first file a visitor to your repository will see. A README file, along with a repository license, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, helps you share expectations and manage contributions to your project.
