15. [Define communication standards](https://github.com/MrN00b1101/AtomAntik/issues/3)

We are using these issues to track our progress and to communicate with the team using features like Assignees, Labels, Milestones and Comments.

For this small project we only using 2 Labels (For now)
+ Enhancement
+ Documentation



### Projects
1. [AFP-Documentation](https://github.com/users/MrN00b1101/projects/1/views/1)
2. [AFP-Terraform code](https://github.com/users/MrN00b1101/projects/4)

The **_Documentation_** and **_Terraform code_** projects helps us follow and track the progress of the issues and tasks. For this we also using the basic features GitHub provides. 

These are following statuses:
+ Todo
+ In Progress
+ Done

We found out these are just enough for us to work on this small project.
It helps us see visually where are the issues stands and what we need to do and where we need to provide help to other team members.
These GitHub projects are easy to use with the Drag-and-Drop feature or just select the status of the issue on the issue page itself.
