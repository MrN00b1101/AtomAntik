#   Pipeline workflow
  
Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for Terraform involves automating the process of provisioning and managing infrastructure using Terraform code. Below is a simplified example of how you might structure a CI/CD pipeline for Terraform using popular tools like GitHub Actions.

### 1. Directory Structure:

Assume the following directory structure for your Terraform project:

```
`my-terraform-project/
|-- terraform/
|   |-- main.tf
|   |-- variables.tf
|-- .github/
|   |-- workflows/
|       |-- terraform-ci-cd.yml
|-- scripts/
|   |-- apply.sh
|   |-- destroy.sh` 
```
### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow:

Create a GitHub Actions workflow file in `.github/workflows/terraform-ci-cd.yml`. This file defines the CI/CD pipeline.

```

`# .github/workflows/terraform-ci-cd.yml

name: Terraform CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup Terraform
      uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1

    - name: Terraform Init
      run: terraform init ./terraform

    - name: Terraform Plan
      run: terraform plan -out=tfplan ./terraform

    - name: Terraform Apply
      run: terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan ./terraform

    - name: Deploy Application (Replace with your deployment steps)
      run: bash scripts/deploy.sh

    - name: Terraform Destroy (Optional)
      run: terraform destroy -auto-approve ./terraform` 
```
This workflow triggers on each push to the `main` branch. It sets up Terraform, initializes the configuration, creates a plan, applies the plan, deploys the application (replace with your deployment steps), and optionally destroys the infrastructure.

### 3. Deployment Script:

Create deployment scripts if necessary. For example, in `scripts/deploy.sh`:

```
`#!/bin/bash

# Replace this with your actual deployment steps
echo "Deploying the application..."` 
```
### 4. Secrets and Environment Variables:

For sensitive information like API keys or credentials, use GitHub Secrets or other CI/CD tools' equivalent mechanisms to securely store and inject these values into your workflow.

### 5. Execution:

Push your changes to the `main` branch, and the GitHub Actions workflow will be triggered automatically. Check the GitHub Actions tab for the progress and results.

This is a basic example, and real-world scenarios may involve more advanced features such as conditional steps, multiple environments, integration testing, and more. Customize the workflow to fit your specific requirements and best practices.
