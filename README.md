Welcome!

This is a repository for the Alkalmazások fejlesztése projekt labor course in Eszterházy Károly Katolikus Egyetem. We are the team AtomAntik!

Are you tired of encountering numerous types of human errors during your work, and you can't do anything about it? If you are looking for **solutions** to problems arising from manual steps in workflows, then you are in the right place!

In the following, we shed light on a technology that not only **automates solutions** but also records every change within the project, making the progress of tasks more **transparent**. The technologies of GitHub and Terraform satisfy all such needs, so let's stay tuned!

- We provide guidance on their usage through the links which you can **find in the header**.
- We recommend progressing further according to the diagram, which you can find **below** the introduction.
- If you're stuck in the middle of the lecture, just take your time and read it once again. Practice makes perfect!
